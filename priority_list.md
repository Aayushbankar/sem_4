# 🏆 Topper's Priority List (The "Cheat Sheet")

This list ranks topics by **Return on Investment (ROI)**—marks gained vs. effort to learn.

## 🚨 PRIORITY 1: The "Must-Know" (Guaranteed 40-50 Marks)
*These topics appear in almost every single paper. Master them first.*

1.  **5 Steps of Ethical Hacking** (Recon -> Scanning -> Access -> Maintain -> Tracks)
2.  **Phases of Digital Forensics** (Identification -> Preservation -> Analysis -> Documentation)
3.  **CIA Triad** (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)
4.  **Public Key vs Private Key Cryptography** (Diff + Diagrams)
5.  **Malware Types** (Virus vs Worm vs Trojan)

### 📊 DMW (Data Mining)
1.  **KDD Process** (Diagram + Step explanation)
2.  **OLTP vs OLAP** (Differentiation table)
3.  **Star Schema vs Snowflake Schema** (Diagrams essential)
4.  **Apriori Algorithm** (Be ready to solve a small numerical example)
5.  **Data Preprocessing Steps** (Cleaning, Integration, Transformation, Reduction)

### 🤖 FML (Machine Learning)
1.  **Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning** (Definitions + Examples)
2.  **Confusion Matrix** (Draw it + Define TP, TN, FP, FN, Accuracy, Precision)
3.  **K-Means Clustering** (Algorithm steps)
4.  **Linear vs Logistic Regression** (When to use which)
5.  **Overfitting vs Underfitting**

### 📡 MCN (Mobile Computing)
1.  **Mobile IP Architecture** (HA, FA, CoA, MN, CN)
2.  **GSM Architecture** (OSS, BSS, NSS, MS)
3.  **Bluetooth Protocol Stack** (Diagram)
4.  **WLAN Modes** (Infrastructure vs Ad-hoc)
5.  **IP vs Mobile IP** (Why do we need Mobile IP?)

### 💼 ES (Entrepreneurship)
1.  **Entrepreneur Characteristics** (Risk-taker, Innovator, etc.)
2.  **SWOT Analysis** (Definition + Example Grid)
3.  **Business Plan Contents** (What goes inside a project report?)

## ⚡ PRIORITY 2: High-Yield (Safe for 60+ Marks)
*Topics that are frequent but sometimes rotated.*

*   **CSDF:** Cyber Laws (Sec 65, 66), MD5/SHA Hashing details, DMZ, Firewall Types.
*   **DMW:** Clustering methods (Hierarchical), Decision Trees, Web Mining (Content/Structure/Usage).
*   **FML:** SVM (Support Vector Machine) concept, Neural Network basics (Perceptron), Naive Bayes.
*   **MCN:** WAP Architecture, Snooping TCP, 5G features, DHCP.
*   **ES:** 4Ps of Marketing, Patent vs Copyright, MSME Registration process.

## ⚠️ "Viva Traps" & Practical Overlaps
*Questions often asked in Viva or Lab Exams that you can reuse in theory papers.*

1.  **"What tool did you use?"** -> Mention **NMAP**, **Wireshark**, **Weka**, **Python (Scikit-Learn)**.
2.  **"Difference between Virus and Worm?"** -> Virus needs host, Worm doesn't.
3.  **" Explain `k` in k-Means"** -> Number of clusters (user-defined).
4.  **"What is a port scanner?"** -> NMAP.
