# Numerical Problem Solver

**Purpose:** Solve numerical problems with complete derivations, formula justifications, and step-by-step reasoning.

---

## Solving Protocol

### 1. Problem Analysis
- Identify given quantities (with units)
- Identify what is asked
- Identify relevant formulas/theorems

### 2. Formula Selection
- State the formula explicitly
- Explain why this formula applies
- Note any assumptions or conditions

### 3. Step-by-Step Solution
- Substitute values with units
- Show intermediate calculations
- Carry units through computation
- Box/highlight final answer

### 4. Verification
- Dimensional analysis check
- Sanity check (order of magnitude)
- Alternative method if applicable

## Rules

- Never skip steps even if "obvious"
- Always include units in every step
- Explain formula choice, don't just state it
- If multiple methods exist, mention them
- Round only at the final step
